# Markdown to HTML Viewer\n\nThis project provides a simple, single-file web application that dynamically converts a Markdown file (`input.md`) into a styled HTML page. It leverages modern web technologies to offer a clean and responsive viewing experience.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Dynamic Markdown Rendering**: Automatically fetches `input.md` and renders its content as HTML.\n*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring the page looks great on various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).\n*   **Styled Content**: Custom CSS integrates seamlessly with Tailwind to provide a readable and aesthetically pleasing display for all Markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, tables, etc.).\n*   **Easy to Use**: A single HTML file with inline scripts and styles, making it highly portable and simple to deploy.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.\n*   **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.\n*   **Marked.js**: A fast Markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use this application:\n\n1.  **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are in the same directory.\n2.  **Open in Browser**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.\n\nThe `index.html` file will automatically fetch `input.md`, convert its Markdown content to HTML, and display it within the page.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n.\n├── index.html     // The main web application file\n└── input.md       // The Markdown file to be rendered\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
